![s](https://cn.pling.com/img/a/2/7/5/24f2db6e5e5b1fdbf52ee58d94a63da9f8ba.jpg)


A clear and easy-on-the-eyes theme that is meant for those who use the XFCE/Gnome-desktop professionally on a daily basis. The focus in this theme is compatibility: GTK-2 applications and GTK-3 applications look virtually the same. Libre-office, Scribus, Evolution, Geary, Planner, GnuCash, LaTeXila, Geany, the Gimp, Inkscape,...

Chrome, firefox, Web and Opera have no issues with this theme.

About the looks, you will notice some Elementary-theme, Arc-theme and Gnome-OSX, in a darker version.



### IMPORTANT:

This is a special edition of PRO-Dark, to use with the XFCE-desktop.

This theme uses GTK 3.20+ for the gtk3-build-apps; GTK2-apps and QT-apps look virtually the same.

### How to install:

Download the theme,

Just copy the extracted file to a '.themes'-folder you make in your home directory.
Then use Appearance/ Window-manager to select the Style.
LOG OUT AND BACK IN for changes to take full effect !
